Developed a full-stack web application for real-time suspect identification using DeepFace for facial recognition and YOLOv8 for object detection. The app allows image upload or webcam input, matches suspects against a U.S.-based dataset, assigns multiple crimes, and generates detailed profiles. It includes multi-role access, a modern UI, and CSV integration for managing records efficiently.
